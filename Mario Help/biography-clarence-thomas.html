    <p>Clarence Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in the small community of Pin Point, near Savannah, Georgia. He was the second of three children born to M.C. Thomas, a farmworker and fisherman, and Leola Williams, a maid. His parents separated soon after his birth, and Thomas grew up in poverty amid the Jim Crow era of segregation. At age seven, following a house fire that destroyed his mother's home, he and his younger brother Myers moved in with their strict Catholic maternal grandparents, Myers Anderson and Christine, in Savannah. His grandfather, a successful fuel-oil dealer with little formal education, profoundly influenced Thomas, teaching him the values of hard work, self-reliance, and faith.</p>
    <p>Thomas received his early education in segregated Catholic schools in Savannah, including St. Benedict the Moor and St. Pius X High School. He attended St. John Vianney Minor Seminary as the first Black student in the segregated boarding school. Intending to become a priest, he studied at Conception Seminary College from 1967 to 1968 but left after hearing racist comments following Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination. He transferred to the College of the Holy Cross on a full scholarship, where he graduated cum laude with a B.A. in English literature in 1971. Thomas then attended Yale Law School, earning his J.D. in 1974.</p>
    <p>After law school, Thomas was admitted to the Missouri bar in 1974 and served as an Assistant Attorney General in Missouri from 1974 to 1977 under future U.S. Senator John Danforth. He worked as an attorney in the legal department of Monsanto Company from 1977 to 1979. In 1979, he moved to Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant to Senator Danforth, focusing on issues before the Senate Commerce Committee.</p>
    <p>In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education, a position he held until 1982. He then served as Chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990, where he reorganized the agency, improved efficiency, and enforced anti-discrimination laws while opposing racial quotas and numerical goals.</p>
    <p>President George H.W. Bush nominated Thomas to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1989; he was confirmed in March 1990 and served for 19 months. Following Justice Thurgood Marshall's retirement, Bush nominated Thomas to the Supreme Court on July 1, 1991. The Senate confirmed him 52-48 on October 15, 1991; he was sworn in on October 23.</p>
    <p>Since 1991, Justice Thomas has been an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, becoming the second African American to serve on the Court and the longest-serving current member as of 2025. A staunch originalist and textualist, he interprets the Constitution based on its original public meaning and has advocated overruling precedents on issues like affirmative action and abortion. He has authored key opinions on Second Amendment rights and religious liberty. Thomas married Virginia "Ginni" Lamp in 1987 and has one son, Jamal Adeen, from a previous marriage.</p>
